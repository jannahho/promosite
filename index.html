<h3>RULES and OBJECTIVE</h3>

<p class="p4">
  All players form a single team. In the first round (level 1) each player receives 1 card, in the second round (level 2) they receive 2 cards, and so on. At each level the team members must put down all their cards in the correct order in the center of the table in a stack, one after the other. For example (4 players, level 1): 18-34-41-73. The players do not take turns in any particular order. Whoever wants to put down a card, simply does so. However, the players must not disclose anything about their own cards - no sharing of information, no secret signals. With The Mind Extreme, there's not just one stack in the middle of the table like with the original but two at the same time! The stack with the white numbers is ascending (1-50), the stack with the red numbers is descending (50-1). In some levels the cards even have to be laid face down in the middle of the table, which makes the collective sense of time even more challenging. If the team succeeds in completing all the stacked levels, they have won together! If the team has to give up the last life, they have unfortunately failed.
